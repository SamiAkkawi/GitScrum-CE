**Why GitScrum mascot is a Rabbit?**
One of the most famous sequences in mathematics is named after the Italian Leonardo Pisano Bigollo (Fibonacci to his mates). In his 1202 masterwork, Liber Abaci, he conducts a thought experiment about the growth of a population of rabbits.

## Feature overview

#### Board
See tasks, collaborate and marvel at project progress in real-time.
Our Board is an incredible visual tool that provides an overview of the current work status, designed to simplify team communication and maximize efficiency in performing tasks.

#### Mind Mapping
Mind maps are the best way to break down big goals into actionable tasks.
Mind mapping makes it easy to brainstorm, planning project requirements, thoughts, suggestions, ideas, comments, meeting minutes, discussion notes etc.

#### Rock Star Team
Find the people who are doing the best work and make meritocracy reign.
Easily evaluate performance so you can reward your Biggest Rock Stars and send motivation to the stratosphere.

#### Task Checklist
Plan your work, add a list of items needed to track and complete the task.
We believe that checklists are essential to increase productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness in completing tasks.

#### Form2Task
Public forms can be viewed and filled out by anyone. 
This feature makes it easier to collect information; you can send a form to customers and collect their responses in a few different ways, depending on their needs.

#### Sprints
The heart of Agile. Manage iterations short enough to keep the team focused.
Burndown charts allow you to know how many units of work are being “DONE” in each sprint. Measure and track performance, so you can adapt and understand how much work your team is delivering at all times!

#### My Next Tasks
List all tasks assigned to you on projects. One of the reasons for GitScrum being well accepted for its users is that it was designed for high-performance teams.

#### Time Tracking
Seamless Task Time Tracking with intuitive tracking interface. Time tracking software establishes accountability in teams because it is possible to understand which employees completed certain tasks when the jobs were completed and how much time was put into each job.

#### User Stories
User stories should be clear and provide a non-technical language. The idea after reading a user story is that the team understands why they are working, and what is the value created by each activity performed.

#### Discussions
Discussions help you communicate for project details. Comment on your tasks to help keep team members aligned with the same goal. 

#### Templates
Standardize your work with customizable templates. Stop wasting time starting the same process over and over again. Only you know how to run your company.

#### White Label
Our white label solution that will "wow" your clients and helps to grow your business
The GitScrum White Label solution allows you to apply your branding, use a custom domain name and remove GitScrum branding.
